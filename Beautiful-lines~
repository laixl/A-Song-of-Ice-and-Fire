###### NIGHT WATCHER SWEAR
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the fire that burns against the cold,
     the light that wakes the sleepers,
     the shield that guards the realm of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
     for this night,
     and all the nights to come.


The man who fears losing has already lost.

-Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?
-That is the only time a man can be brave.
--Bran&Ned

If we die, we die. But first we'll live.

When you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.

"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.--Varys.

The more people you love, the weaker you are.

When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There si no middle ground.--Cersei Lannister
