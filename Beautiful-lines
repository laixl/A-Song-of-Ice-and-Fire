###### NIGHT WATCHER SWEAR
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the fire that burns against the cold,
     the light that wakes the sleepers,
     the shield that guards the realm of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
     for this night,
     and all the nights to come.


The man who fears losing has already lost.

-Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?
-That is the only time a man can be brave.

If we die, we die. But first we'll live.

When you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.
