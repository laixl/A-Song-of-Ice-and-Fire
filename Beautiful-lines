###### NIGHT WATCHER SWEAR
Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the fire that burns against the cold,
     the light that wakes the sleepers,
     the shield that guards the realm of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
     for this night,
     and all the nights to come.


The man who fears losing has already lost.

Bran: Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?
Eddard: That is the only time a man can be brave.

Arthur: And now it begins.
Eddard: No. Now it ends.

If we die, we die. But first we'll live.

When you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.

"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.--Varys.

The more people you love, the weaker you are.

#####Cersei Lannister
When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There si no middle ground.
Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.

Some battles are won with swords and spears, others with quills and ravens.
